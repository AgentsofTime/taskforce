## Front-running
Frontrunning attacks use the time between a transaction being submitted as a pending transaction and when it is confirmed on the blockchain to perform the same transaction. This is important when certain transactions will lead to some sort of financial gain for the sender. 

Attackers will monitor the mempool, the holding place for pending transactions, and see which transactions are valuable to frontrun. They will then submit that transaction with a higher gas fee so that it is at a higher priority and thus will be confirmed before the original one.
