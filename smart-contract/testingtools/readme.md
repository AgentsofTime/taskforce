## Testing Tools
One of the most popular tools for testing is [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/). Truffle allows you to write tests in both Javascript/TypeScript to emulate an external application interacting with your contract and in Solidity for more advanced cases. 

Here is a video explaining how to create tests using Truffle.

Within the Truffle suite is another tool called Ganache. Ganache allows you to create a local blockchain on your machine. This will create multiple wallet accounts that you can then use to deploy and interact with your smart contract in a zero-cost and risk environment. 

This video will explain how to deploy a smart contract using Ganache and a local blockchain: 

Once you feel confident that your smart contract is passing the required tests, it is time for the last stage of the development lifecycle, deployment. In the next lesson, we will go over how and where you can deploy your smart contract!
